# HEXTRA-3 Section Numbering System

## Overview

This document establishes the mapping from the current letter-based section identifiers (A-G) to the standardized numerical section system. While code comments currently use letter identifiers, this numerical system provides better scalability and allows for hierarchical organization of components going forward.

## Current Status

- The application codebase currently uses lettered sections (A-G) in comments
- The HEXTRA Color System documentation references a numerical system (Section 8.0)
- This document formalizes the complete mapping to ensure consistency in future development

## Section Mapping

| Original Letter | Numerical Identifier | Description | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| Section A       | Section 1.0          | Banner | |
| Section B       | Section 2.0          | Title and RGB Color Disc | |
| Section C       | Section 3.0          | Grayscale Tool Bar | |
| Section D       | Section 4.0          | HEX Input Bar | |
| **--- Separator ---** | | | *Consistent with tight padding to maximize space* |
| Section E       | Section 5.0          | Main Image Window Title/Image Loading | |
| Section F       | Section 6.0          | Main Image Window | PNG/WebP support |
| Section G       | Section 7.0          | Image Adjustments | With Advanced toggle (hide section) |
| **--- Separator ---** | | | *Consistent with tight padding to maximize space* |
| (New)           | Section 8.0          | BULK Image Generation | Batch Processing |
| (New)           | Section 9.0          | HEXTRA Color System (HCS) | Color Wheel, Nearest Match component, Color Catalog with swatches |
| (New)           | Section 10.0         | Footer | Must appear on every page with " 2025 HEXTRA Color System. All rights reserved." |

## Logical Groupings

The interface is organized into three main functional groups separated by visual separators:

1. **Color Selection Group** (Sections 1.0-4.0)
   - Primary tools for selecting and defining colors
   - Includes banner, color wheel, grayscale tools, and HEX input

2. **Image Processing Group** (Sections 5.0-7.0)
   - Tools for viewing and manipulating individual images
   - Includes image loading, display, and adjustment features

3. **Advanced Features Group** (Sections 8.0-10.0)
   - Specialized functionality requiring authentication
   - Batch processing, color system management, and app-wide footer

Each group is visually separated by a consistent separator with tight padding to maximize available space while maintaining clear visual organization.

## Hierarchical Structure

The numerical system allows for hierarchical component organization:

```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code References**: All section references in code should use the numerical identifiers for consistency
2. **Comments**: Include both identifiers in comments for transition period: `// Section 4.0 (formerly Section D)`
3. **Component Names**: Update component names to reflect numerical system where appropriate
4. **Documentation**: Use numerical identifiers in all new documentation

## Migration Strategy

The transition from letter-based to number-based sections should be handled in phases:

1. **Documentation Phase**: Update all documentation to include both identifiers
2. **Code Update Phase**: Gradually update code comments and identifiers
3. **UI Reference Phase**: Update any UI elements that reference section letters
4. **Final Transition**: Remove letter references once numerical system is fully established

## Benefits of Numerical System

1. **Scalability**: Easier to insert new sections (e.g., 7.5) without disrupting sequence
2. **Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships between components
3. **Organization**: Better grouping of related functionality
4. **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all documentation and code
5. **Future-proofing**: Adaptable to application growth and new features
